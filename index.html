        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a Manchester Codes student with background in Information Technology, Finance and Accounting. Solution-minded, customer-centric, thoughtful and kind. And YES! You guessed right, I could be really boring atimes. I love my family and would like to have a dog some day.</p>
        <p>I did some coding in C++ as an undergraduate student, but I stopped after getting into Finance. However, during my MSc programme, we depended heavily on 'STATA' for data and statistical analysis and I struggled with it. Afterwards, the pandemic came, ideas started flying around, coupled with inexcusable opportunities for self-learning. LOL. Consequently, it occurred to me that I needed to start coding again in order to actionate the ideas. So, here I am!.</p>
